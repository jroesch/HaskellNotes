#LectureOne
##Big Picture Ideas
This is the begining of the course, we will spend the next 10 weeks examining computer theorem proving. The course is split into two definite pieces. The first three weeks will be focused on functional programming, and understanding how it differs from traditional imperative programming. Then in the 7 following weeks we will move into Coq, a theorem proving tool that is rooted very much in functional programming, and will allow us to build formal systems, that can be used to prove propeties about both programs, and general theorems.

We will focus on some of the conceptual big picture ideas today them move onto the basic syntax of Haskell.
